README for Data-Matrix-Generated Archive

Your download includes one or more MAF files.  TCGA MAF files must contain 34 defined columns, however centers are free to add additional columns. Since MAF files created using the Data Matrix contain only the 34 required columns and do not contain any of the additional columns, this can result in the appearance of duplicate rows. If your MAF file appears to have duplicate rows, check the original MAF file and see if there are additional columns of information.
In addition, MAF files generated through the Data Matrix will include new columns indicating the MAF file the entry came from, the archive name and the row number of the entry in the MAF file (if known).
